## Privacy Policy

This App and the Researchers (We, Us or Our) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.

This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data We collect from You or that You provide to Us will be processed by Us.  Please read the following carefully to understand Our views and practices regarding your personal information and how We will treat it.

Please direct any queries about this privacy policy or the academic study to Alexander Loth (alexander.loth@stud.fra-uas.de).

### GDPR Statement

The legal basis for using your personal data is to carry out a task (i.e. academic research) in the public interest.

Please contact Alexander Loth (alexander.loth@stud.fra-uas.de) with any questions about this privacy policy or the academic study.

### Information we may collect about you 

We do not seek to collect or store information that would allow us to identify individuals using this application. To protect your privacy, we will only collect information that you choose to share with us if you agree to participate in the study. If you choose not to participate in this study, we will not collect any information about you. The information you choose to share with us may include your responses and results, as well as any questions you voluntarily choose to answer, which may include your age, education level, political affiliation, or other demographic variables. We collect device information such as browser version, operating system, and screen size. We also identify your location at the city level using the https://freeipapi.com/ service. All information we collect is stored on a password-protected computer accessible only to academic researchers.

### Data Retention

We will keep the information you provide for as long as it is needed for the study.

### Uses of information

We use the information we hold about you in the following ways
- To administer Our Site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;
- To improve Our Site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device/computer;
- To allow you to participate in interactive features of Our Service, if you choose to do so;
- as part of Our efforts to maintain the security of Our Site;
- for research purposes conducted internally or by trusted third parties.
- Your information will only be used for non-commercial, non-political, scientific purposes to help us better understand people's behavior related to misinformation.

### Where we store your personal information

All information you provide to us will be stored on secure servers, both within the European Economic Area (EEA) and only with GDPR-compliant international data processors. Where international data processors are used, all appropriate technical and legal safeguards are in place to ensure that you receive the same level of protection as within the EEA.

Once We have received your information, We will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. We will retain personal information for as long as necessary or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was collected and in accordance with applicable law.

### Data Sharing to Meet Open Science Standards

In order to comply with open science standards administered by academic journals, we may share limited raw data on open science platforms for others to replicate or re-analyze. This data will exclude any personally identifiable information (age, gender, etc.) from the self-report questions, so there are no privacy risks or risks of de-identifying individuals. We will only display data about your results, not the information you share about your personal preferences or demographics. 

### Deleting Data

If you wish to delete your data, we will generate a unique, anonymous, randomly generated ID that you can use to request deletion of your data by emailing Alexander Loth (alexander.loth@stud.fra-uas.de) with the ID within one year of completing the study. Your user ID will be displayed after you complete the consent form. Alternatively, if you lose this ID, you can tell us as much as possible about your submission and we will try to locate it and delete it.

### Your rights

Data protection legislation gives you a number of rights in relation to your personal data, including but not limited to the right to access information held about you.

Our website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks and affiliates.  If you follow a link to one of these sites, please be aware that these sites have their own privacy policies and that we are not responsible or liable for those policies.  Please review those policies before submitting any personal information to those sites.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Any changes We may make to Our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you on the Site itself. Please check back periodically for any updates or changes to Our Privacy Policy.
