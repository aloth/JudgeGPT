## The Research Mandate: Why JudgeGPT Exists

Generative AI has initiated a technological arms race between the creation of hyper-realistic synthetic media and the development of tools to detect it. While much research focuses on automated detection, a critical gap exists in understanding **human perception**: How do people judge the authenticity of content when the lines between human- and machine-generated text are increasingly blurred?

As identified in our foundational survey, *"Blessing or Curse? A Survey on the Impact of Generative AI on Fake News"* ([arXiv:2404.03021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03021)), there is a pressing need for empirical data to understand how these technologies influence public trust and information integrity. Our follow-up research extends this work in two directions:

- *"Industrialized Deception: The Collateral Effects of LLM-Generated Misinformation on Digital Ecosystems"* (WWW '26 Companion, [arXiv:2601.21963](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21963)) examines the systemic effects of LLM-generated misinformation on digital platforms, trust networks, and information ecosystems.
- *"Eroding the Truth-Default: A Causal Analysis of Human Susceptibility to Foundation Model Hallucinations and Disinformation in the Wild"* (WWW '26 Companion, [arXiv:2601.22871](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22871)) reports the human perception findings from stimuli generated by this framework.

JudgeGPT is not merely a survey; it is a **live research platform** designed to systematically collect and analyze human judgments on news authenticity at scale.

## Research Pipeline

JudgeGPT operates as the second stage of a two-part experimental apparatus:

```

1. **Controlled Stimulus Generation ([RogueGPT](https://github.com/aloth/RogueGPT)):** Fragments are produced with explicit control over model, style, language, format, and seed phrase. All generation parameters are persisted alongside the content. The corpus currently spans **37 model configurations** across 10 providers, 4 languages, 3 formats, and 5 journalistic styles per language.

2. **Data Storage (MongoDB):** Each fragment, along with its full provenance metadata, is stored in a shared MongoDB database, enabling reproducible filtering by any experimental variable.

3. **Human Evaluation (JudgeGPT):** Participants assess fragments on continuous dual-axis scales (source attribution and authenticity), producing quantitative perception data linked to generation parameters.

4. **Analysis:** The combined dataset supports investigations into model-specific detectability, cross-linguistic perception differences, and the role of individual differences in judgment accuracy.

## Platform Features

### Core Survey Instrument

Participants evaluate news fragments along three dimensions:
- **Source Attribution** (Human vs. Machine Generated) on a 7-point scale
- **Veracity Assessment** (Legitimate vs. Fake News) on a 7-point scale
- **Topic Familiarity** (self-reported domain knowledge) on a 7-point scale

Each response is timestamped and linked to the participant's demographic profile, enabling multi-factor analysis of perception accuracy.

### Post-Response Reveal

After each submission, participants receive immediate feedback revealing:
- **Ground truth:** Whether the fragment was human- or machine-generated
- **Model identity:** The specific LLM that produced the content (e.g., "GPT-5.2 (OpenAI)")
- **Accuracy feedback:** Whether the participant's assessment was correct
- **Streak tracking:** Consecutive correct answers to sustain engagement

This feedback loop serves both educational and research purposes: it functions as an "inoculation" mechanism (as described in the misinformation literature) while maintaining participant motivation for longer sessions, thereby increasing data volume and quality.

### Shareable Score Card

Every 5 responses, participants receive a visual score card summarizing their performance:

```
🔍 JudgeGPT — Can You Spot AI Fakes?

🤖 AI Detection:  🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜ 80%
📰 Fake News:     🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜⬜⬜ 60%
📊 10 fragments evaluated

Can you beat my score? 👇
```

Participants can share results via **X (Twitter), LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Email** with a single click. Each share includes a challenge link (see below), creating a viral recruitment mechanism for the study.

### Challenge Mode

Participants can challenge others to evaluate the **exact same set of fragments** via a URL-encoded challenge link. The link encodes fragment IDs and the challenger's score, enabling:

- **Direct comparison:** "Someone scored 85% — can you beat them?"
- **Reproducible evaluation:** Both participants see identical stimuli, enabling controlled pairwise comparisons
- **Organic recruitment:** Each challenge link is a self-contained invitation to participate in the study

Challenge links require no additional database infrastructure; fragment identifiers are Base64url-encoded directly in the URL.

### Gamification & Engagement

| Feature | Research Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **Accuracy badges** (≥70%) | Reward sustained engagement; increase session length |
| **Streak counter** | Maintain attention quality through intrinsic motivation |
| **5-response milestone cards** | Create natural sharing moments; drive organic recruitment |
| **Challenge mode** | Enable pairwise comparison data; viral participant acquisition |

These mechanisms are not incidental: longer sessions and higher participant counts directly improve the statistical power of the resulting dataset.
